    Tier precedence between candidates is already settled before this call; what a
    tier decides here is how far it may act on a *model* span:

    * AUTH and CONTEXT may add a span where the model found nothing, and may widen
      a model span of the same label. The difference between them is upstream —
      CONTEXT candidates that collided with an AUTH region no longer exist.
    * SNAP never adds a whole candidate. It only widens a model span of the same
      label that it overlaps; a structured candidate that crosses a differently
      labelled model span may still retain its non-overlapping remainder.

    One invariant holds across every tier: a regex span never erases a model span of
    a different label. That collision is recorded as a conflict and the model wins.
    A same-label widening is applied only when a rule of that label accepts the
    unioned text, so a union can never manufacture a value no rule would match.

    Returns:
        The model-precedence merge result with accepted candidates and conflicts.
