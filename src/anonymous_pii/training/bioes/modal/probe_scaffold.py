"""Shared Modal scaffolding for the BIOES training probes and full runs.

Every probe in this package declares the same four things: a source-mounted
image, the Hugging Face cache and artifact volumes, a JSONL event log on the
artifact volume, and an isolated child process that does the paid GPU work.
Only the packages, the GPU options and the child body differ per probe, so
those stay in the probe module and everything else lives here.

# reason: Deliberately deferred rather than fixed here: this directory holds every spend-authorization

# reason: `__init__.py` is a post-merge change whose proof is a real GPU smoke run — owner ledger item.
