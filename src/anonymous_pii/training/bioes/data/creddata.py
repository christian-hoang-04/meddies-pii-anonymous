r"""Convert Samsung/CredData credential annotations into Anonymous Labels span records.

CredData annotates credentials by ``(LineStart/End, ValueStart/End)`` over code
files. This converter resolves each TRUE (``GroundTruth == 'T'``) credential's
``Category`` to a Anonymous Labels label, locates it in the file, and emits a windowed
code snippet with the credential as a span. False/Unknown (``F``/``X``) rows and
non-PII categories stay in the snippet text untagged — natural hard negatives.

Offset convention matches CredData's own code (obfuscate_creds.py / review_data.py):
lines are 1-indexed inclusive, columns are 0-indexed Python-slice; the file text is
normalized ``\\r\\n``/``\\r`` -> ``\\n`` BEFORE splitting on ``\\n``; a multi-line
value runs from ``ValueStart`` on the first line to ``ValueEnd`` on the last.

Category -> Anonymous Labels (priority, highest wins):
  credential -> ``secret``  >  URL Credentials -> ``private_url``
  >  UUID / AWS Client ID / *app id -> ``id_number``  >  drop (untagged).
``CryptographyKey == 'Public'`` -> drop (a public key is not a secret).
