# ruff: file-ignore[ambiguous-unicode-character-string]
# reason: this module's confusables ARE its subject matter — the adversarial PII corpus names the
# reason: evasion it must generate, so normalising them to ASCII would delete the technique itself.
# ruff: file-ignore[hardcoded-password-string]
# reason: hand-written synthetic training text whose POINT is to look like an obfuscated secret, so
# reason: the BIOES model learns to tag the `secret` label. Both strings are fabricated and
# reason: deliberately spaced; neither is live and no service would accept either.

    These examples are not meant to replace the real data audit. They cover
    OPF-style weak slices that were sparse in the current Anonymous Labels data and are
    suitable for smoke training or a held-out adversarial eval file.

    Returns:
        The hand-written examples as Anonymous Labels records. They are constructed rather than
        sampled, so the set is stable across runs and small enough for a person to check --
        which is the point: it covers the obfuscation shapes the real corpus is thin on.
