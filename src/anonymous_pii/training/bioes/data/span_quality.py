"""Acceptance-side span-quality filter.

It drops structure-capture and garbage spans
while preserving the messy-but-real ACCEPTABLE hard cases.

See `$CONTEXT/docs/data-quality-criteria.md`. The load-bearing distinction is
decoration-vs-containment: noise that *decorates* the entity is kept; scaffolding
that *contains* it (a FHIR/JSON/DICOM block with the PII as a nested field) is the
span and is dropped. Targets STRUCTURE + multiplicity, never raw length, so OCR
noise / concatenation / native scripts / JWT cookies survive.

Implements the false-reject-safe subset: V1 (struct-prefix), V2 (struct-body),
V3 (phone ceiling), V5 (email-shape), V7 (entity-presence: id/phone need a digit;
>60-char human_name spanning sentences is paragraph-capture). V8 (doc-quarantine)
lives in the assembler. Deliberately deferred as too false-reject-risky without
semantic checks: V4 date/address prose, V6 numeric-secret (would clip 6-digit
OTPs), company-name and date entity-presence (no safe surface pattern).
