"""Release payload construction for the verified step-250 PII350 checkpoint.

The release claim is decode parity with the benchmark. The published inference
path therefore does not reimplement BIOES decoding: this module vendors the
exact decode sources the evaluation adapter imports, rewriting only their import
prefixes so the payload stands alone, and proves behaviour with a span-level
parity probe against the adapter itself.

Everything here is CPU-only and free of Modal wiring, so the packaging steps are
importable and testable on their own. ``scripts/ops/export_pii350_release.py``
holds the Modal app that drives them.
