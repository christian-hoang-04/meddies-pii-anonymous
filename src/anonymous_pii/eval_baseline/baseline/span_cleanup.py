"""Shared span post-processing for token-classification adapters.

Encoder NER models (openmed/DeBERTa, opf) emit noisy subword-level tags: a span
carries leading whitespace and trailing punctuation, and a single entity is often
split across word-boundary ``B-`` tags. ``clean_spans`` repairs both — trim the
boundaries to the entity core, then merge same-label fragments separated only by
whitespace — so exact-boundary scoring is fair. Used by every encoder adapter.
