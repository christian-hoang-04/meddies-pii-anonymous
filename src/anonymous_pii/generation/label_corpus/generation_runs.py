    Replacing the old fixed-order + daily rotation that let the dominant provider's fastest languages run away while
    english (last in the list) starved. `baseline` is the on-disk count at run start; `produced` tracks what this run adds,
    so the workers measure deficit without re-globbing the corpus every round.

    out_dir is per-account (set in the worker) so concurrent accounts never share an accepted.{lang}.jsonl — otherwise the
    generator's file-based accepted_count would tally every account's rows. The downstream BIOES assembly globs
    synthetic/**/accepted*.jsonl, so per-account subdirs are collected automatically.

    One concurrent worker per (provider, account). Each account generates batches across every language until it hits one
    of its OWN daily ceilings (RPD/TPD -> safe_generate returns "budget_exceeded"), the wall-clock deadline passes, or
    max_rounds passes complete. Every account runs in parallel, each throttled by the ledger on all four axes
    (RPM/RPD/TPM/TPD), so each account drives toward its full daily quota and a slow account (e.g. llm7 at 1 rpm) never
    blocks the rest.

    Hard wall-clock bound: cancel any account still running at the deadline (a slow llm7 account, a throttled provider) so
    the run always ends on time and writes its usage summary. The between-cell check above lets accounts stop gracefully;
    this cancels the ones stuck mid-request. Accepted samples are appended to disk as they pass, so cancellation loses at
    most the one in-flight sample per account.
