    return f"""You generate fully synthetic PII training documents for a Anonymous Labels BIOES span detector.

Output only the document. No preface, no explanation, no markdown code fence unless the requested \
document itself is structured text.

Language: {profile.name}.
Domain: {domain}.

Allowed positive labels, and only these labels:
{labels}

Annotation format is exactly `[specific synthetic value]<label>`.
Every positive label marker must be immediately preceded by a square-bracketed value.
Never write `value<label>` or dangling `<label>` markers.
For JSON, XML, HL7, tables, or logs, the string field value itself must contain `[value]<label>`.
Good format examples:
- `[Maya Green]<human_name>`
- `[maya.green@example.com]<email_address>`
- `[https://portal.example.test/patients/P-104/results?token=tok_8f91]<private_url>`
- `[otp-482-119]<secret>`
Bad format examples:
- `Maya Green<human_name>` because the value is not bracketed.
- `<human_name>Maya Green` because the label appears before the value.
- `[Maya Green] <human_name>` because a space splits the value and label.
- `[Maya Green]<human_name` because the closing `>` is missing.
Human names are always PII. Dates are PII only when tied to a patient/person/encounter/credential; \
public guideline/article/copyright dates are not PII.
Private URLs are patient portals, signed links, private records/results/claims/messages, or URLs \
with patient/session/token/auth parameters. {public_url_rule}
Secrets are passwords, OTPs, PINs, API keys, bearer/access/auth/session/CSRF tokens, cookies, reset links/codes.
Phone numbers must be tagged as the full phone number, including country/area code and extension \
when present. Do not tag a 4-digit extension or suffix as a standalone `<phone_number>`.

Tag the MINIMAL entity value only — never a whole sentence, title, heading, descriptive clause, or \
document label. `company_name` is the institution name itself (the clinic/hospital/insurer name), \
not a sentence describing it.
When digits are spoken aloud or OCR-transcribed as words, still tag by WHAT the number is: a \
contact phone number is `<phone_number>`; a patient/record/claim/insurance/account identifier is \
`<id_number>`. Tag the full spoken span but do not absorb trailing narration words.
Never tag vitals, lab measurements, dosages, medical terms, diagnoses, procedure names, medication \
names, age, sex/gender, or public/non-person facts.
All names, addresses, IDs, URLs, emails, tokens, dates, and institutions must be fictional; use \
reserved example domains (example.com, example.org, example.net, example.test) for emails and URLs.
Make every phone number and identifier look realistic and varied; never use lazy sequential or \
repeated digit runs such as 0987654321, 0123456789, or 1111111111."""

10. Do not output a checklist, legend, label inventory, or bare label such as `<human_name>` without a value.
11. If you use a phone number, bracket the whole number; do not tag short suffixes, extensions, or \
fragments as `<phone_number>`.
12. If you use `<private_url>`, bracket the full private URL including patient/account/session/token/auth query parameters.

token, API key, reset code, or session token.
14. Do not name or describe the document type or format in the output (never write "this is an \
ambient voice scribe transcript" or similar); produce the document content directly.

Minimum coverage before you answer: at least {min_spans} bracketed tags and at least {min_unique_labels} unique labels.

Remember: label syntax must be `[value]<label>` and labels must be one of: \
