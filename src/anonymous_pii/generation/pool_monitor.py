"""Read-only health check for the weak-label provider pool.

Turns a usage record (the shape ``build_usage_record`` produces) into a per-account
verdict — idle / exhausted / lagging / ban-risk / healthy — so an operator can
VERIFY a run utilized accounts correctly and never crossed a documented rate cap
(the ban signature). Backs the ``anonymous-pii pool-status`` command. Pure functions here;
I/O lives in the CLI. Reuses ``account_rpd_cap`` so the verdict and the dashboard
share one definition of each account's real binding cap.
