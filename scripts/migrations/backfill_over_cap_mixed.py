"""Remove rows over the 8192-token cap from ``anonymous-pii-mixed`` and backfill.

The mixed corpus has 443 rows whose ``token_count_lfm25`` exceeds 8192 (the training
cap) — the trainer already skips these, so they are dead weight. This replaces the 405
that are in the 15 "other" languages with fresh same-language, same-domain rows drawn
from the ORIGINAL sources (via the build's own ``iter_records``, so backfill rows are
identical in schema/provenance), keeping only candidates that are (a) ≤ 8192 tokens and
(b) not already in mixed. The 38 English/Vietnamese over-cap rows CANNOT be backfilled —
those pools were fully consumed by the build — so they are dropped without replacement.

Result: 999,962 rows, max token_count ≤ 8192, per-"other"-language counts unchanged,
English/Vietnamese reduced by 29/9. Deterministic (SEED). Dry-run by default; ``--push``
republishes ``anonymous-placeholder/anonymous-pii-mixed`` in place.
